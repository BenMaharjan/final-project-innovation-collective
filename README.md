# Gatherly - *Connect Locally, Unite Globally*

## Project Outline:

### Problem Statement

Loneliness is more prolific in today’s society than ever before. Gen Z, Millenials, and elderley individuals report experiencing high levels of social isolation. Gen Z are said to be the lonliest generation of all-time; 22% of Millennials say they have zero friends; and old age loneliness is the highest it's ever been.  Existing social media platforms lack focus on building lasting and meaningful connections based on mutual interest and locality. 

### Solution

A socially responsible social app that fosters community by helping like-minded individuals find and connect with others within their locality based on shared interests, hobbies and activities. Our app would be aimed at building communities and life-long friendships, both remotely and in-person.   
So, for me for example, it would create a “Dorchester Crypto” chat group based my location and interests setup in my profile.

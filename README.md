### _"Connect Locally, Unite Globally"_

## Project Outline:

### Problem Statement

Loneliness is more prolific in today’s society than ever before. Gen Z, Millenials, and elderly individuals report experiencing high levels of social isolation. Gen Z is said to be the loneliest generation of all time. 22% of Millennials say they have zero friends. And old age loneliness is the highest it's ever been. Existing social media platforms lack focus on building lasting and meaningful connections based on mutual interest and locality.

### Solution

A socially responsible social app that fosters community by helping like-minded individuals find and connect with others within their locality based on shared interests, hobbies and activities. Our app would be aimed at building communities and life-long friendships, both remotely and in-person.

## MVPs

### MVP0 (Pre-Launch Landing Page)

A landing page based on LearnWorlds press release guidelines (so Amazon press release). Possibly with an "are you interested" e-mail subscription form to gauge initial interest.

### MVP1

- #### Step 1

  - A profile page (based on session authentication initially) containing:
    - Profile picture placeholder (use the user's initials as a profile picture to start with)
    - Email address
    - Name
    - Surname
    - Display Name
    - Location
    - Age
    - Gender
    - Interests (should be able to add multiple interests)
  - Database (only for storing profiles, group chats, and server-side session authentication cookies initially)

- #### Step 2

  - A chat page for chatting in your local groups

### MVP2

- Search functionality for chat groups based on location and interests

### MVP3

- Profile pictures
- A profanity filter for chat messages, for example:
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/badwords-list
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity

### MVP4

- Local meetups

### MVP5

- Direct Messages with other users

### MVP6

- Account-based authentication (so signup and login pages) rather than session-based authentication

## Future Features (USPs - Unique Selling Propositions)

These are all still in the ideation or under discussion.

- Local friend recommendations based on your interests and friendship circle.
- Interest prioritisation (for better friend recommendations).
- Age filters - only chat with people in your chosen age range.
- AI-powered chat message verification to avoid threats, hate speech, graphic violence, bullying, etc.
- AI-powered profile picture verification.
- AI-powered chat group and direct message moderation.

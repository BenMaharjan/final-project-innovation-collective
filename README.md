## Project Outline

### Problem Statement

Loneliness is more prolific in today’s society than ever before. Gen Z is said to be the loneliest generation of all time. 22% of Millennials say they have zero friends. And old age loneliness is the highest its ever been.

### Solution

- A very basic social media chat app that is purely based around your interests and location.
  So, for me for example, it would create a “Dorchester Crypto” chat group based my location and interests setup in my profile.

## MVPs

### MVP1

Landing page based on LearnWorlds press release guidelines (so Amazon press release). Possibly with an e-mail "are you interested" subscription form to gauge initial interest.

### MVP2

Literally 2 pages - A profile paged (based on session cookies first). And a chat page for chatting in your local groups.

### MVP3

Add an account creation/login page to link the mvp1 session cookies to an account.

### MVP4

Direct Messages with other members.

### MVP5

Local meetups
